# EEG_Rhythm_Separation
EEG rhythm separation based on multivariate iterative filtering.

We have proposed an adaptive multivariate EEG rhythm separation method based on multivariate iterative filtering [1]. You may get the Matlab code for multivariate iterative filtering on the website: https://github.com/kpdas95/MIF.

For any queries or help, please feel free to write an email to kpdas95@gmail.com. I will be happy to help. Any kind of suggestions is also most welcome.


# Important: you need to download and unzip the code for MIF (https://github.com/kpdas95/MIF) on the working directory to use the EEG rhythm separation code.
