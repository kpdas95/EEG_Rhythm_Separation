# EEG_Rhythm_Separation
EEG rhythm separation based on multivariate iterative filtering.

We have proposed a adaptive multivaraite EEG rhythm separation methodd based on the multivariate iterative filteing [1]. You may get the matlab code for multivariate iterative filteing on website: https://github.com/kpdas95/MIF.

For any queries or help plese feel free to write a mail to kpdas95@gmail.com. I will be hapy to help. Any kind of suggestions is also most welcomed.


# Important you need to download and unzip code for MIF (https://github.com/kpdas95/MIF) on the working directory to use EEG rhythm separation code.
