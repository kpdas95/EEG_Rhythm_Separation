# EEG_Rhythm_Separation
EEG rhythm separation based on multivariate iterative filtering.

We have proposed a adaptive multivaraite EEG rhythm separation methodd based on the multivariate iterative filteing. You may get the matlab code for multivariate iterative filteing on website: https://github.com/kpdas95/MIF.
